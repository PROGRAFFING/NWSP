# NWSP Theme

NWSP: a dead-simple theme based on Timber starter theme. The primary purpose of this theme is to provide a file structure rather than a framework for markup or styles. Configure your Sass, scripts, and task runners however you would like!

## Installing the Theme

Install this theme as you would any other, and be sure the Timber plugin is activated. But hey, let's break it down into some bullets:

1. Clone git repo
2. Run npm install
3. Change ' proxy: "link to your local site" in gulpfile.js
4. Run gulp watch
